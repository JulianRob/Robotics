/*
This is a test of the optical shaft encoder from VEX robotics.
In this test, we are demonstrating the use of two optical shaft encoders to allow
A simple robot to move forward in a straight line. The way this works is by ensuring that
each motor is moving at precisely the same RPM (rotations per minute).
